# "If you run pip install without the --no-deps option, pip will often install dependencies in your conda recipe and those dependencies will become part of your package.
#  This wastes space in the package and increases the risk of file overlap, file clobbering, and broken packages."

#    # you can't add channels in the meta_atmospheric_correction.yaml file.  You can, however add them to condarc, and conda-build will respect that
#    # Conda 4.4 adds some very nice ways of specifying channel on a per-package basis, and conda-build will add support for those specs in meta_atmospheric_correction.yaml sometime soon.
